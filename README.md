## 🛠️ Steps Implemented
1. **Revisited Bio Page** – Updated the existing page design.
2. **2-Column Layout** – Used `display: flex;` to place photo and text side by side.
3. **Alignment** – Added `align-items: center;` for vertical centering.
4. **Centered Content** – Applied `max-width: 900px; margin: auto;`.
5. **Responsive Design** – Ensured layout adapts to smaller screens (photo above text).
